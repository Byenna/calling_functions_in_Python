# 1. Define a function named `kg_to_pounds` that takes a weight in kilograms (`kg`) as input.

# 2. Inside the `kg_to_pounds` function, multiply the weight (`kg`) by the conversion factor `2.20462`. This will give you the equivalent weight in pounds.
# 3. Return the calculated weight in pounds.
# 4. In the main part of your program, prompt the user to enter a weight in kilograms.
# 5. Use the `input` function to read the user's input and convert it to a float using the `float` function.
# 6. Call the `kg_to_pounds` function with the entered weight as the argument, and assign the result to a variable named `converted_weight`.
# 7. Print the converted weight using the `print` function, with an appropriate message.
# Here's an example implementation of the program:
